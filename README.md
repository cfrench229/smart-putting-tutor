# Smart Putting Tutor

A work-in-progress embedded system designed to analyze golf putting mechanics
using an IMU sensor and embedded Linux.

## Project Goals
- Capture high-frequency motion data from an IMU
- Process and analyze putting stroke characteristics
- Provide meaningful feedback for improving consistency
- Practice real-world embedded, C++, Python, and ML workflows

## Planned Tech Stack
- Embedded Linux (Raspberry Pi)
- C / C++
- Python (data analysis & ML)
- IMU sensors
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Unit testing (GTest)

## Status
🚧 Early development — hardware setup and repository structure in progress.
